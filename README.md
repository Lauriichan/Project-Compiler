<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### How it began
This project was created to help my classmates in school to learn Java.<br/>
In the very restricted environment we got on our school computers it is completly impossible for us to install applications which is why I decided to create this project.<br/>
Without a compiler learning how to write Java is quite complicated.
<br/><br/>
Also another reason for the creation of this project was that the program our teacher uses to teach us Java is in my opinion unsuitable to learn real Java programming.<br/>
As the conecpt of classes and object oriented programming is not given.

### What is this program
This program is a project manager for Java Projects.<br/>
It also provides some templates to start with.<br/>
Every template includes the base structure needed to compile the project with this the compile feature of this program.<br/>
The program has a diagnostics tab which shows all errors and warnings that the that the compiler gives.<br/>
At last this program is also able to run those Java projects.<br/>
Input and Output is handled via the Console tab.<br/>
There are also settings for a default editor and the Java version to run the project with.<br/>
The main interface provides a list of all projects, a option to export / import a project and there you can compile / execute the projects.<br/>
You are not able to execute the project if it wasn't compiled before.<br/>

### More project details
This project contains a UI library based on Java Graphics.<br/>
This UI library was developed solely by me and is probably not the best you can get in terms of performance.<br/>
The reason why I choose to write a own UI library was because I don't like Java AWT / Swing / FX.<br/>
Another reason was that in my opinion it was a challenge creating one because there are some difficulties like how do you scroll through components without messing up the rendering of the containers or other components and stuff c:
<br/><br/>
If you want to use any of the components written in this project then feel free to do so.<br/>
As long as you don't tell people that you wrote them its fine for me ^^

### Built With

* [SyntaxApi](https://github.com/SyntaxPhoenix/syntaxapi)
* [JNAFileChooser](https://github.com/steos/jnafilechooser)
* [FastUtil](https://github.com/vigna/fastutil)
* [Apache Commons IO](https://github.com/apache/commons-io)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation

To use this application you only need to have at least JDK 1.8 installed.<br/>
You can download the latest version of this application [here](https://github.com/Lauriichan/Project-Compiler/releases/latest) and you only need to execute it using Java.<br/>
You can find a suitable JDK version [here](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot)!<br/>
Once it is started it will generate a config folder, so I recommend putting this application into a seperate directory.
